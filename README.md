Nearing the end of The Odin Project, my project included creating an "etch-a-sketch" where the user can interact with a flexible grid of squares to add colors to them.

One thing I may go back and do is add a toggle feature so that the user can select between having the colors be filled in simply by hovering over the squares or when holding the mouse button down.
